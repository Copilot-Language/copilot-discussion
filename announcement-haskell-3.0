Dear all,

We would like to announce the release of Copilot version 3.0. Copilot is a
stream-based DSL for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an
emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements.

Copilot is typically used as an runtime verification framework, where programs
serve as specifications to the system we want to monitor. Additional
libraries provide utility functions for, temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL),
clocks and voting algorithms.

Over the years, Copilot has been in use at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems
Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones.

The new release contains a number of new features to make writing programs
easier:

* The language has been extended with support for monitoring and generating
  structs and arrays in a type-safe manner.

* A completely rewritten C99 code generator to support the new features.

* Significant improvements on the quality and readability of the output code,
  which helps in traceability and certifications of the code.

* Internal simplifications for a more future proof codebase.

For more information on Copilot, including installation instructions and links
to the source code and documentation, please visit the webpage [1].

Kind regards,
The Copilot developers
