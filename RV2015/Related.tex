\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}
The research reported on here builds on recent  research conducted in a number
of areas including formal verification, functional programming and
eDSL design, and RV.  

Copilot has many features common to other RV frameworks aimed at
 monitoring distributed or real-time systems.  
There are few other instances of RV frameworks targeted to C code.  One exception is {\sc
  Rmor}, which generates constant-memory C monitors~\cite{havelundc}.  {\sc
  Rmor} does not address real-time behavior or distributed system RV,
though.   Research at the University of Waterloo also investigates the use of
 RV using  periodic sampling~\cite{sampling}.  Unlike with Copilot, the authors
do not make the assumptions that the target programs are hard real-time
themselves.  JavaMOP~\cite{javamop}  uses aspect-oriented techniques
to allow one to write sophisticated monitors. To our knowledge no
other RV framework has integrated monitor verification tools into
their systems. 

Haskell eDSLs are of growing popularity and given that they are all
embedded into the same programming language, they share many
similarities with Copilot. FeldSpar~\cite{feldspar} is designed for digital signal
processing;  Kansas Lava~\cite{Gill:14:DSLs} is designed for
programming  field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs);
Ivory~\cite{pike-plpv14} is designed for writing secure autonomous
systems.
