\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Runtime Verification (RV), where monitors detect and respond to
property violations at runtime, can help address several of the
verification challenges facing ultra-critical
systems~\cite{pike-rv-11}.  As RV matures
it will be employed to verify increasingly complex 
properties. For instance, checking complex stability properties of a
control system or ensuring that a critical system is fault-tolerant.
Strictly regulated ultra-critical areas such as civil aviation,
systems must demonstrate highly predicable behavior in order to be
certified. As interest grows in techniques such as adaptive flight
control and fully autonomous vehicles that utilize learning to adapt
to unpredictable environments, RV may be a way to regain the necessary
level of predictability required of ultra-critical
systems~\cite{simplex}.  If
monitors in ultra-critical systems are to be the last line of defense,
then we need to ensure they are correct.  As the monitors we execute
at runtime become more and more sophisticated, applying formal
verification tools to the monitors to ensure they are correct can help
safeguard that the last line of defense is actually effective. 


This paper documents our first efforts in incorporating formal
verification of monitors with a RV framework.  The case study applies
our approach to the Copilot language, and framework initially
developed at the National Institute of Aerospace and Galois Inc under
a contract to NASA~\cite{copilot,pike-isse-13}.  Inspired by reports
from working engineers on the utility of the integration of model
checking into the Lustre framework~\cite{Hagen08} our initial efforts
have focused on the verification of safety properties using advanced
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based bounded model
checking~\cite{ClarkeBounded01} tools.

 
The next section provides the reader with the necessary background on
Copilot. Section~\ref{sec:prover} introduces the new Copilot prover interface
that we. In Section~\ref{sec:example}  several examples illustrate the
application of the tool to the Boyer-Moore majority vote
algorithm. Section~\ref{sec:structure} provides an overview of
implementation details. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}
discusses future work and concludes.

% In this short paper, we describe
%initial results of an ongoing effort to integrate model checking
%technology into the Copilot RV  framework in order to verify
%our monitors before they are deployed in unltra-critical systems.  

%As interest grows in techniques such as
%adaptive flight control and fully autonomous vehicles that utilize
%learning to adapt to unpredictable environments, architectures have
%been proposed~\cite{XX} that use RV to switch from the more exotic
%uncertified software to a certified, but less capable, system when
%safety properties are violated.
