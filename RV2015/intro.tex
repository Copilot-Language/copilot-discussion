\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Runtime Verification (RV), where monitors detect and respond to
property violations at runtime, can help address several of the
verification challenges facing ultra-critical systems.  As RV matures
it will be employed to verify more and more sophisticated
properties. For instance, checking complex stability properties of a
control system or ensuring that a critical system is fault-tolerant.
Strictly regulated ultra-critical areas such as civil aviation,
systems must demonstrate highly predicable behavior in order to be
certified. As interest grows in techniques such as adaptive flight
control and fully autonomous vehicles that utilize learning to adapt
to unpredictable environments, RV may be a way to regain the necessary
level of predictability required of ultra-critical systems.  If
monitors in ultra-critical systems are to be the last line of defense,
then we need to ensure they are correct.  As the monitors we execute
at runtime become more and more sophisticated, applying formal
verification tools to the monitors to ensure they are correct can help
safeguard that the last line of defense is actually effective. The
ongoing work described here focuses on the verification of safety
properties by applying temporal reasoning using a first order logic
with built in theories for equality over uninterpreted symbols and
linear real and integer arithmetic. To date our work has focused on
verifying inductive properties by applying $k-$induction using
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based model checking. 

The case study applies our approach to the Copilot language and
 framework initially developed at the National Institute of Aerospace
 and Galois Inc under a contract to NASA.  


%Copilot is a stream

% In this short paper, we describe
%initial results of an ongoing effort to integrate model checking
%technology into the Copilot RV  framework in order to verify
%our monitors before they are deployed in unltra-critical systems.  

%As interest grows in techniques such as
%adaptive flight control and fully autonomous vehicles that utilize
%learning to adapt to unpredictable environments, architectures have
%been proposed~\cite{XX} that use RV to switch from the more exotic
%uncertified software to a certified, but less capable, system when
%safety properties are violated.
