\section{Future Work and Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We have surveyed an ongoing research effort initiated by the authors
to augment the  Copilot framework
with a  verification capability  with the  goal  increasing our confidence in
the monitors that act as watchmen.  The reported efforts have
primarily focused on verifying inductive properties using
$k-$induction. Our solution is not a panacea as any model checking
solution is subject to the well known state explosion problem, but 
the results in verifying both simple and relatively complex monitors
are promising. 

 In the near term, we to continue our collaboration with the Kind2
 team as the prover gets more sophisticated and provides a more
 flexible interface. Given we already output SMTlib format in order to
 interface with Yices, we will investigate connecting to other provers
 that use that input format. Finally, we shall investigate interfacing
 with MetiTarski~\cite{TTT}.
