\section{Future Work and Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

 Ultra-Critical systems are quickly evolving in complexity, and assured
 RV is a necessary complement to traditional assurance techniques.  
In this paper, we have presented the development of
\texttt{Copilot-Kind} that enhances the Copilot RV framework with an
integrated model-checking capability for verifying monitors.
Verified  monitors are by no means sufficient for ensuring assured RV
since a safety case is far more encompassing, but it is a necessary
condition.


\subsubsection{Assurance} The reported efforts have
primarily focused on verifying invariant properties of monitors using
$k-$induction. Our solution is not a panacea as any model checking
solution is subject to the well known state explosion problem, but 
the results in verifying both simple and relatively complex monitors
are promising. 

\subsubsection{Efficacy of the eDSL Approach} First, we have
demonstrated that the embedded DSL approach is powerful and flexible
in that we were able to extend the Copilot RV framework with
verification capabilities. Being embedded in a  higher-order functional language
facilitated the creation of  a number of features such as our proof
scheme capability. The fact Copilot is a Haskell based eDSL yielded
very  concise properties. For instance, in Section~\ref{sec:mvote}
the power of higher-order expression is well illustrated in 
function  \texttt{forAllCst} for the
serial Boyer-Moore example in that it  uses both a  a \texttt{fold}
and a \texttt{map} operator to model finite conjunctions. 


\subsubsection{Future Work} In the near term, we continue our
collaboration with the Kind2 team as the prover gets more
sophisticated and provides a more flexible interface. Given we already
output SMTLib format in order to interface with Yices, we will
investigate connecting to other provers that use that input
format. Finally, we shall interface the verification with
MetiTarski~\cite{AkbarpourPaulson}, which would allow us to discharge
proofs of invariants involving real-valued special functions.
