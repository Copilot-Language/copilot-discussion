\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

 Ultra-Critical systems are quickly evolving in complexity, and assured
 RV is a necessary complement to traditional assurance techniques.  
In this paper, we have presented the development of
\texttt{Copilot-Kind} that enhances the Copilot RV framework with an
integrated model-checking capability for verifying monitors and
illustrated its applicability to verify a range of monitors.


The development of \texttt{copilot-kind} has reinforced the efficacy
of the embedded DSL approach. Being embedded in a higher-order
functional language facilitated the creation of a number of features
such as our proof scheme capability. We have also found it quite
advantageous to be able to write properties in the familiar style of
Haskell programs. For instance, in Section~\ref{sec:mvote}, the
function \texttt{forAllCst} for the serial Boyer-Moore example in that
it uses both a \texttt{fold} and a \texttt{map} operator to model
finite conjunctions.  Beyond our own purposes, we believe that other
embedded DSL developers could use our designs in order to interface
their languages with proof engines.

Verified  monitors are by no means sufficient for achieving assured RV,
since a safety case is far more encompassing, but it is a necessary
condition.  Having applied our tool to rather
sophisticated monitors,  future extensions are planned.  Of particular
interest is an interface to 
MetiTarski~\cite{AkbarpourPaulson}. This would allow us to discharge
proofs of invariants involving real-valued special functions, which
arise quite often in the domain of cyber-physical systems.
