\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

I've found it best to start with a general report document like this one to work in and then later customize it for a particular
 confernece or journal. 


The basic ideaa is to describe the end-to-end verification of our well clear monitor
 starting with the mathematical/PVS. We would describe Copilot and the formulation of the well clear spec. We would then describe how we verify that the monitors do indeed satisfy the mathematical properties verifed in the PVS model. 

We would then describe how we synthesize assured monitors (C programs) from the Copilot spec. If space allows we would explain that when practical we would generate verified Machine code  using CompCert. Giving us an end-to-end assurance argument.
