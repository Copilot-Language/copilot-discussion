\section{Copilot RV Framework}~\label{sec:Copilot}

% A short introduction to the copilot language and framework.

Copilot is a language tailored to developing runtime monitors for hard
real-time, distributed, reactive systems. Briefly, a runtime monitor is a
program that runs concurrently with a target program with the sole purpose of
assuring that the target program behaves in accordance with a pre-established
specification\citep{monitors}. Copilot is a language for writing such
specifications\citep{copilot, pike-icfp-12, pike-isse-13}. It is an embedded
domain-specific language, hosted in the lazy functional programming language
Haskell.
