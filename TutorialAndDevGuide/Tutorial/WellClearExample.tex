\section{Well Clear Example}~\label{sec:WellClear}

\todo[inline]{Here we will add a detailed description of well clear example}

\begin{itemize}
\item Intro to the problem of monitoring aircraft
\item Overview of concept of well clear citing papers and maybe include some of the PVS models
\item Our monitors with description maybe we show both PVS and Copilot with explanation
\item Properties we have proven
\item code generation 
\item what we had to do to run on ground station. 
\end{itemize}

One application that suits well to the Copilot language is the monitoring of
violations of separation criteria between two planes. We decided to implement
the Well-Clear criterion as an example of practical use.

\todo[inline]{Put here some WellClear stuff}.

Do not forget:

\begin{itemize}
	\item m4
	\item no let binding (everything in functions)
	\item magic labels
	\item following the PVS model (show examples on how close it is). Except for the arrays (HUGE mux stack).
	\item magic makefile
	\item cross compilation on windows
	\item writing the main associated with.
	\item making it work.
\end{itemize}
