\frametitle{Well-Clear : Making it work}

^^IThe main.c file, producing a complete executable, was written and is effective.
^^I\begin{itemize}
^^I^^I\item OS : Windows 7, 64 bits (without any additional feature).
^^I^^I\item Input : on stdin, an integer (0 for new plane entering the control area, 1 for leaving, 2 for updates) and an identification number (ICAO24 ideally). If it is an update, we have to add on stdin the latitude, longitude, altitude, x, y and z velocity (x east, y north, z up).
^^I^^I\item Output : some debug information and a matrix on which a cross appears if a Well Clear Violation occurs (the shape of the cross depends on the type of violation, according to different time variables).
