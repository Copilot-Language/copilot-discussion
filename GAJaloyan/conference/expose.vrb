  ^^I^^IA program is a list of streams that can be either external  or internal which are defined by mutually recursive stream equations.

  ^^I^^IEach stream has a type which can be \texttt{Bool}, \texttt{Int8}, \texttt{Int16}, \texttt{Int32}, \texttt{Int64}, \texttt{Word8}, \texttt{Word16}, \texttt{Word32}, \texttt{Word64}, \texttt{Float}, \texttt{Double}.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
x :: Stream Word16
x = 0
-- x = {0, 0, 0, ...}
y :: Stream Bool
y = x `mod` 2 == 0
-- y = {T, T, ...}
nats :: Stream Word64
nats = [0] ++ (1 + nats)
-- nats = {0,1,2, ..., 2^64-1, 0, 1, ..}
\end{minted}
