\section{Intermediate Language}~\label{sec:il}

Each prover first translates the Copilot specification into an
intermediate representation best suited for model checking. Two
representations are available :

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \textbf{IL} format : a Copilot program is translated into a list
  of quantifier-free equations over integer sequences, implicitly
  universally quantified by a free variable \emph{n}. Each sequence
  roughly corresponds to a stream. This format is the one used in G.
  Hagen's thesis~\cite{HagenPhD}. The \emph{light prover} works with this
  format.
\item
  The \textbf{TransSys} format : a Copilot program is \emph{flattened}
  and translated into a \emph{state transition system} {[}1{]}.
  Moreover, in order to keep some structure in this representation, the
  variables of this system are grouped by \emph{nodes}, each node
  exporting and importing variables. The \emph{Kind2 prover} uses this
  format, which can be easily translated into the native format.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cnub} is a simplified representation of a Copilot program where
only the informations useful for SMT-based model checking are kept. For
now, it is not used by the two standard provers but it could be used in
the future as an intermediate step in the translation from
\texttt{Copilot.Spec} to \texttt{IL.Spec} or \texttt{TransSys.Spec}.

For each of these formats, there is a folder in
\texttt{src/Copilot/Kind} which contains at least * \texttt{Spec.hs}
where the format is defined * \texttt{PrettyPrint.hs} for pretty
printing (useful for debugging) * \texttt{Translate.hs} where the
translation process from \texttt{Core.Spec} is defined. 

These three formats share a simplified set of types and operators,
defined respectively in \texttt{Misc.Type} and \texttt{Misc.Operator}.
