Overview
========
This repo includes papers and technical reports on
[Copilot](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/Copilot/), a stream (i.e.,
infinite lists) domain-specific language (DSL) in Haskell that compiles into
embedded C.  Copilot is similar in spirit to languages like Lustre.  Copilot
contains an interpreter, multiple back-end compilers, and other verification
tools.

Resources
=========

A main starting point is the [Copilot
website](https://copilot-language.github.io/).

You can obtain the latest version of the Copilot tutorial
[here](https://copilot-language.github.io/copilot_tutorial.pdf).

Please see the files under the Examples directory in the
[Copilot](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/Copilot/tree/master/Examples) for
a number of examples showing the syntax, use of libraries, and use of the
interpreter and back-ends.  The examples is the best way to start.
