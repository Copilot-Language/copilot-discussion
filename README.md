Overview
========
This package discusses issues with Copilot and includes documentation.

Copilot is a stream (i.e., infinite lists) domain-specific language (DSL) in
Haskell that compiles into embedded C.  Copilot is similar in spirit to
languages like Lustre.  Copilot contains an interpreter, multiple back-end
compilers, and other verification tools.

Examples
=========
Please see the files under the Examples directory in the
[Copilot](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot) for a number of examples
showing the syntax, use of libraries, and use of the interpreter and back-ends.
The examples is the best way to start.
