\section{Opportunites for Toolbuilders}\label{sec:oportunities} 
We have fond case studies involving both
domain and safety experts invaluable at informing our research agenda
high assurance RV and encourage researchers working in the area to do
so as well.  Tools that can aide domain experts in validating safety
properties are in sorely needed.  As in our case study, the safety
properties of cyber-physical systems are involve continuous
mathematics. While advances in SMT solvers have been impressive, it is
still necessary to often resort to interactive theorem provers, which
require specialized skills that domain experts are not likely to
obtain.  There are many opportunities to design  domain specific decision procedures
that can help automate a class of analyses. 



At times it can be a daunting task to simply
ascertain if the values in the specification are present in the act If the RV approach involves
instrumenting code, then static analysis can both assist in the
instrumentation and prove that the instrumentation did not affect the
correctness of the code. If sampling, static analysis has the
potential to inform when to sample. 
  
  Much more work in fault-tolerant RV remains
 to be done and we hope that the broader RV community will take up the
 challenge Static analysis tools have been very effective in detecting
 software faults such as divide by zero errors. Analysis of more
 sophisticated architectural fault tolerance has strained fully
 automated techniques such as model checkers so analysis of realistic
 systems requires inter


\paragraph{Opportunities} RV monitors offer a rich target for
researchers building proof engines and static analysis tools.  In
spite of tremendous improvements in SMT solvers, the continuous math
used in cyber-physical systems .e have not yet found an automated
proof engine that can prove properties of formula with trigonometric
functions. Static analysis techniques, such as abstract interpretation,
could be applied to show a floating point error might arise before the
monitor is even generated. Finally, there are opportunities for
investigating integrating interactive provers in the RV framework.
