\section{Introduction}~\label{sec:intro} 
Safety-critical systems, such as aircraft, automobiles, and medical
devices, are those systems whose failure could result
in loss of life, significant property damage, or damage to the
environment~\cite{Knight2002}.  The  grave consequences of failure have compelled
industry and regulatory authorities  to adapt conservative design
approaches and exhaustive verification and validation (V\&V) procedures
to prevent mishaps. In addition, strict licensing requirements are
often demanded on human operators of  many safety-critical systems.
In practice, the verification and validation of avionics
and other safety-critical software systems relies heavily on it being
predicable and existing regulatory guidance  such as
DO-178~\cite{DO178B}  do not  have provisions to
assure safety-critical systems that are not predictable at certification. 
Yet technological advances are enabling the development of increasingly
autonomous (IA) cyber-physical  systems that modify their behavior in response
to the external environment and learn from their experience.  While
unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and self-driving cars have the
potential of transforming society in many beneficial ways, they also
pose new dangers to public safety. The algorithmic methods such as
machine learning that enable autonomy lack the salient feature of
being predictable since the system's behavior depends on what it has
learned.  Consequently, the  problem  of assuring safety-critical IA is
both a barrier to industrial use of  as well as a 
systems is a considerable research challenge~\cite{NRC14}.


\emph{Runtime verification} (RV)~\cite{monitors}, where monitors
detect and respond to property violations at runtime, has the
potential to enable the safe operation of safety-critical systems that
are too complex to formally verify or fully test.  Technically
speaking, an RV monitor takes a logical specification $\phi$ and
execution trace $\tau$ of state information of the system under
observation (SUO) and decides wheter $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$. The
\emph{Simplex Architecture}~\cite{simplex} provides a model
architectural pattern for RV, where a monitor checks that the
executing SUO satisfies a specification and If the property is
violated, the RV system will switch control to a more conservative
component that can be assured using conventional means that
\emph{steers} the system into a safe state.

\emph{High-assurance} RV provides an assured level of safety even when
the SUO itself cannot be verified  by conventional
means. Copilot~\cite{copilot, pike-isse-13} is an RV framework
targeted at safety-critical hard real-realtime system, which we have
recently applied to our program of high-assurance RV.  


\paragraph{Contributions:} During the course of our research on we
have been guided by the general question of ``what questions must be
addressed  to make a
convincing case that  high-assurance RV can safeguard a
system that cannot be otherwise assured.''  In this paper, we
chronicle a number of  challenges we have identified that must be
thoroughly addressed in order to actualize high-assurance RV.  We hope
that this helps inform other researchers that wish to apply RV to
safety-critical systems. We examine  how  these issues have been
addressed in our own work   with the help of a running example. A general theme of our
application of lightweight formal methods to achieve
high-assurance.
