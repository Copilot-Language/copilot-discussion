Question: Can the monitor detect a violation of the specification and invoke the safety controller in time to preserve safe operation.  
    }
}

\begin{itemize}
\item One can view cyber-physical system composed of layers with the
decision making at a higher layer than the physical control. In
robotics, we usually separate out the planning from the actuation. In
avionics, the flight management can be thought of as being at a higher
layer than the flight controls. Typically the controllers require
millisecond response times, where the planners and flight management
have much   
\item In the case of control s/w, the RV must detect a possible
violation of stability in time to react. Mention Stan and Taylor's
work.
\item A flight management s/w it's hard to say. Need to take action if the
FMS goes off and doesn't generate plans in time - a real possibility
for genetic algorithms and what not. 
\item Scheduling monitors in a RTOS so we know they at least execute
at a certain rate is how we have tried to address this with our
investigations of 653 RTOS.
