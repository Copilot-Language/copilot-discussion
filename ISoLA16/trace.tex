 Question: Is there tracibilty from the reqirememts and system level anaylsis to the actual monitor code?
    }%
}

\begin{itemize}
\item Many conventional processes based  guidance
  documents require ``traceability'' from the requirements to the
  executable. 
\item In assured RV we should be able to trace from requirements to
  monitor spec to monitor. 
\item We have developed a feature for adding labels to Copilot specs
  facilitating traceability.  
\item  We leveraged the GNU dot tool to help visualize what is going
  on. 

\end{itemize}
