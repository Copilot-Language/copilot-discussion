        Copilot is an RV framework
        targeted at safety-critical hard real-realtime systems, which
        has served as an experimental platform enabling a research
        program in high-assurance RV.  Copilot is a domain specific
        language embedded (EDSL) in the functional programming
        language Haskell tailored to programming monitors for hard
        real-time, reactive
        systems.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Copilot-Language}}

Copilot is a \emph{stream} based language where a stream is an
infinite sequence of values that must conform to the same type.  All
transformations of data in Copilot must be propagated through
streams. Copilot guarantees that specifications compile to
constant-time and constant-space implementations. Copilot streams
mimic both the syntax and semantics of Haskell lazy lists with the
exception that operators are automatically promoted point-wise to the
list level.

Two types of temporal operators are provided in Copilot, one for
delaying streams and one for looking into the future of streams:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
(++) :: [a] -> Stream a -> Stream a
drop :: Int -> Stream a -> Stream a
\end{lstlisting}
%
Here {\tt xs ++ s} prepends the list {\tt xs} at the front of the stream {\tt
  s}.  The expression {\tt drop k s} skips the first {\tt k} values of the
stream {\tt s}, returning the remainder of the stream.



Copilot's toolchain is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:toolchain}. A
Copilot program is reified (i.e., transformed from a recursive
structure into explicit graphs) and
then some domain-specific type-checking is done.  At this point, we
have transformed the program into the ``core'' language, an
intermediate representation.  The core package contains an interpreter
that can be viewed as an operational semantics for the language.  The
back-end translates a Copilot core program into the language of
another Haskell-hosted EDSL, Symbolic Bit Vectors (SBV)\footnote{\url{http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv}, BSD3 license.}, an EDSL
developed by Levent Erk\"{o}k, which we use to generate C monitors.

% Aspects of the toolchain relevant to high assurance are covered in more
%detail later.

%We use the recent Safe Haskell compiler extensions to implement
%Copilot~\cite{safe}.  Copilot's language package is explicitly \emph{Trustworthy
% Haskell}, as there is a single instance of {\tt unsafeCoerce} to implement
%observable sharing.  Copilot's core language is written in \emph{Safe Haskell}.



% Given that
%Copilot is deeply embedded in Haskell, one must have a working
%knowledge of Haskell to effectively use Copilot. However, the benefit of an
%embedded DSL in Haskell is that the host-language serves as a type-safe,
%Turing-complete macro language, allowing arbitrary compile-time computation,
%while keeping the core DSL small.
