\section{From Whence the Specification}~\label{sec:req}
Sound systems engineering practices  as well
as regulatory guidelines typically mandate safety-critical systems
have detailed written requirements and as well as a through safety
assessment. Safety is a systems level property and  high-assurance RV recognizes
that if RV specifications are to indeed provide safety guarantees,
then the  monitor specifications must flow down from the requirements
and safety analyses.   Indeed, Rushby's study~\cite{rvRushby,RushbyAIAA09} demonstrated
that  a convincing safety case~\cite{Kelly98arguingsafety} for an IA
system protected by RV  demands evidence that the
monitor specifications are  derived from validated requirements and in
addition that the monitor specifications should include checks of the assumptions on
which safe operation of the system rests  are indeed satisfied. 
and monitors specifications should follow from these.
Thus leading to our first challenge for
assured RV.


\paragraph{Challenge:}   \emph{ Monitor specifications should derive from
  system level requirements and assumptions that have been validated
  by domain experts.} 

\paragraph{Copilot Approach:} We are conducting case studies informed
by collaborations with colleagues who are developing new concepts that
will enable aircraft to perform autonomous flight by self-optimizing
their four-dimensional trajectories while conforming to constraints
such as required times of arrival generated by air-traffic service
providers on the ground. Some of the proposed 
algorithms~\cite{KarrVRC} do not  behave with the
predictability of conventional systems.   Consequently, it is not 
possible to provide the required level of assurance that the newly
computed trajectories preserve safe aircraft separation, where the
separation requirement for two aircraft is specified by a minimum
horizontal separation $D$ (typically, $5$ nautical miles).  
Fortuitously, colleagues at NASA have discovered analytical formula,
called \emph{criteria}~\cite{NM2011NASA,NMH14ATIO} that characterize
those resolution maneuvers that both ensure safe separation when one
aircraft maneuvers and ensures separation when two conflicting
aircraft both maneuver. The criteria  have been
extensively validated by domain experts emplying sophisticated
simulation as well as mathematical proof using the Prototype
Verification System (PVS) theorem prover. These criteria were encoded
as Copilot specificaitons. The criteria for horizontal separation for
two aircradt is given as follows:
%$$ \texttt{horizontal\_criteria}(\bm{s}, \epsilon)(\bm{v'})
%\equiv  \bm{s} \cdot \bm{v'} \geq \epsilon  \frac{\sqrt{\bm{s} \cdot
%  \bm{s}  - D^2}} {D} \operatorname{det}(\bm{s},\bm{v'})$$ 

\begin{eqnarray*} \texttt{horiz\_criteria}(\bm{s}, \epsilon, \bm{v})
& \equiv &  \bm{s} \cdot \bm{v} \geq \epsilon  \frac{\sqrt{\bm{s} \cdot
  \bm{s}  - D^2}} {D} \operatorname{det}(\bm{s},\bm{v})  \\
& \wedge &  \epsilon \operatorname{det}(\bm{s},\bm{v})  \leq  0 
\end{eqnarray*}


where $\bm{s}$ and $\bm{v}$ are the  relative position  and velocity
vectors for the two aircraft, $\epsilon$ is $1$ or $-1,$  and 
$\bm{v}$ is the relative velocity vector after a planned maneuver. 
The position is  assumed to be given in Earth Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF)
coordinates.  This is easily encoded in  Copilot's EDSL as:

%\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
%scalar2dim :: Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double
%scalar2dim x1 y1 x2 y2 = (x1 * x2) + (y1 * y2)
%
%normsq2dim :: Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double
%normsq2dim x y = scalar2dim x y x y
%
%norm2dim :: Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double
%norm2dim x y = sqrt (normsq2dim x y)
%
%det2dim :: Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double
%det2dim x1 y1 x2 y2 = (x1 * y2) - (x2 * y1)
%
%----------------------------------------
%-- Horizontal Criterion for Conflict Resolution
%----------------------------------------
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
hor_rr :: Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double
hor_rr sx sy e v'x v'y = (sqrt $ (normsq2dim sx sy) - (minHorSep * minHorSep)) / (minHorSep)

horizontalCriterionForConflictResolution :: Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Double -> Stream Bool
horizontalCriterionForConflictResolution sx sy e v'x v'y = ((scalar2dim sx sy v'x v'y) >= (e * (hor_rr sx sy e v'x v'y) * (det2dim sx sy v'x v'y)) ) && ( ((det2dim sx sy v'x v'y) *e)  <= 0.0)
\end{lstlisting}

Formalizing the assumptions about the reliability of communicating
aircraft position data is ongoing work. 


 








%\begin{itemize}
%\item Safety-Critical that that are considered ultra-critical systems

%  actually checking properties based on formal requirements.
% \item Need to make sure that the RV safety properties are derived
%  from requirements. 
% \item Criteria based separation example an excellent example in that
%  has undergone extensive analysis both simulation and formal
%  analytical proof.  Assumptions are well spelled out. 
% \item NASA is investigating sophisticated AI based  flight management

%  the criteria can an can serve as the basis for RV. 
%\item EDSL we strive to build libraries allow specification in this

%The obvious specification is simply check to see if the aircraft have
%violated separation and take corrective action.  system level
%needs demanded a specification that the aircract will not come into
%conflict meaning separation is not lost in at some time $t>0.$


%These are expressed as a collection of formula
%involving the position and velocity vectors of the two
%aircraft.
