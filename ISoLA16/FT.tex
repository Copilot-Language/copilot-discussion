\begin{itemize} 
\item Complex safety-critical systems often have Hazard analysis,
  FMEA, .... mandated.
\item  While control engineers often
  equate safety with stability, structural engineers with structural
  integrity, and  s/w engineers with software correctness, it is
  really a systems issues. 
\item Each discipline's contribution is often vital to ensuring safety
  and will provide critical evidence to a safety case that the
  system is safe. 
\item Given our focus on safety-critical systems we can, we can assume
  that hazard analysis, FMEA, .... analysis are done in the
  requirements phase.
\begin{itemize}
\item DO 178B 2.2.3 Monitor should not be rendered inoperable by the
  same failure conditions that cause hazards.
\item DO 178B 2.2.3  Dictates that the RV should be ``assigned the
  same software level as most severe failure condition''.
\item Assured RV for autonomous systems must respect a fault model so
  as to not fall victim to the hazards and common mode failures
  detected in analysis. 
\end{itemize}
\item Extensive safety analysis (hazard analysis, failure mode effects
  analysis (FEMA), zonal analysis, etc. 
\item RV should be able to handle faults allowable under fault model.
\item Redundancy and independence as well as associated redundancy
  management must be included in the RV system.
\item We have investigated how to engineer fault-tolerant monitors to
  withstand known hazards of sensor failure (pitot tube) failure. 
\item Redundant HW stack, consensus to withstand 1 Byzantine fault. 
\item Conducted experiments not only to demonstrate the FT, but to
  see how the system responded when the defined safety threshold of
  one fault is surpassed. 
\item Monitors and steering code need to be isolated from faults in
  the SUO. 
 \begin{itemize}
\item We have investigated both separate/redundant RV HW stack 
\item We have investigated how to architect the monitor system so as
  run monitors and steering code in separate partitions on a VX-Works
  653 compliant system. 
\end{itemize}
