Safety engineers employ a range of established methods to identify
hazards and failure modes~\cite{Levenson}.  The level of desired
reliability determines what faults the system must be designed to
tolerate. If RV is to be the guarantor of safety, then it must at
least meet the level of reliability demanded of the system as a whole.
This implies that the RV be designed to be
\emph{fault-tolerant}~\cite{butler-faults}, meaning it that continues
to provide its required functionality in the presence of faults.  A
fault-tolerant system must not contain a \emph{single point of
  failure} such that if the single subsystem fails, the entire system
fails.

 Ideally, the RV and the SUO should not be subject to common
 modes of failure.  For instance, software errors in the SUO such as
 numerical overflows an memory leaks that can render a system
 inoperable should not affect the RV.  A fault-tolerant system must
 also be robust in the presence of hardware faults such as sensor failures
 and voltage spikes.  A \emph{fault-containment region} (FCR)
 is a region in a system designed to ensure faults do not propagate to
 other regions~\cite{Rushby01:buscompare}.   The 
 easiest way to ensure this is to physically isolate one FCR from
 another.  However, FCRs may need to communicate, hence they share
 channels. An FCR containing a monitor may need to share a channel
 with the SUO.  Care must be taken to ensure faults cannot propagate
 over these channels. In the case of ultra-reliable systems, the only
 way to achieve the level of fault tolerance demanded of the system is
 by hardware replication that demands complex hardware redundancy
 management software. 


\paragraph{Challenge}   \emph{The RV  should not be rendered inoperable by the
 same failure conditions that cause hazards to the SUO.}


\paragraph{Copilot Approach} Fault-tolerant RV has been a ongoing
topic of investigation for the Copilot research group. The avionics
industry has been migrating away from federated systems toward the use
of integrated modular avionics that provide fault-tolerance as a
service.  The Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated (ARINC)
653~\cite{ARINC653} compliant hard real-time operating systems RTOS
provides temporal and spatial partitioning guarantees so applications
can safely share resources.  The Copilot group has been investigating
design patterns for implementing fault-tolerant RV on such
platforms~\cite{Kaveh15}. Monitors are run on the same nodes as the
software being monitored, but in separate partitions. Monitoring tasks
executing in a separate partition observe the state of the executing
program through very circumscribed
channels that preserve the isolation guarantees.  The spacial and
temporal protections provided by ARINC 653 keep the monitors safe from
other programs running on the same system.

Systems that need be ultrareliable typically must employ redundancy to
tolerate the most pernicious faults such as \emph{Byzantine fault}
(i.e., a fault in which different nodes interpret a single broadcast
message differently.  There are have been  documented incidents in
critical avionics  where sensors failed in a Byzantine fashion with
the potential to affect a vehicle's safety.  The aircraft horizontal separation criteria in
Section~\ref{sec:req} depends on reliably sensing the position and
velocity of both systems. In earlier work~\cite{pike-isse-13}, we have
 addressed this issue in a case study where a system had
redundant sensors and Copilot monitors performed Byzantine exchange and 
majority voting to create a system that could tolerate a single
Byzantine fault~\cite{pike-isse-13}.  Fault injection testing was
performed along with flight tests.  The hardware used in these
experiments were commodity microprocessors, but we have recently
bought Mil-Spec hardened processors that are more reliable when operating
under varying environmental conditions.

%physical faults in separate FCRs are statistically independent, but under
%exceptional circumstances, simultaneous faults may be observed in FCRs.  For
%example, widespread high-intensity radiation may affect multiple FCRs.
