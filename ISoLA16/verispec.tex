\section{Monitor Specification Correctness}~\label{sec:verispec}

As RV is applied to  guarantee sophisticated properties, the
monitor specifications themselves will grow in complexity and may become
prone to error.  Our experience with a number of case studies
involving complex monitor properties is that we were able to discover
many simple theorems that should hold for a correct specification.  Hence, applying formal proof tools to the monitors to
ensure they are correct can safeguard that the last line of
defense is actually effective. Ideally, specification verification
capabilities should be integrated into the RV framework so engineers
could write specifications, verify their correctness, and generate
monitors in a seamless fashion.

\paragraph{Challenge:}  \emph{Assure  the correctness of the monitor
specification.}   

\paragraph{Copilot Approach:}  
 Copilot supports automated proofs of specification
 properties  through its {\tt Copilot.Theorem} module.  Applying a 
``synchronous observer'' approach~\cite{amast93}, properties \emph{about}
Copilot programs are specified \emph{within} Copilot itself. In particular,
properties are encoded with standard Boolean streams and Copilot streams are
sufficient to encode past-time linear temporal logic~\cite{ptltl}.

 A proposition is a Copilot value of type \texttt{Prop} \texttt{Existential}
 or \texttt{Prop} \texttt{Universal}, which can be introduced using \texttt{exists} and
\texttt{forall}, respectively. These are functions taking as an argument a
normal Copilot stream of type \lstinline{Stream Bool}. Propositions can be added
to a specification using the \texttt{prop} and \texttt{theorem} functions,
where \texttt{theorem} must also be passed a tactic for automatically proving
the proposition. Currently, proof engines  based on
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (\textsc{smt})   are used to discharge
proofs.  The Copilot prover was first introduced
in~\cite{pike-rv-15}, where its utility was demonstrated in assuring
notoriously subtle voting algorithms.

In the course of the analysis of the separation criteria, a team of
domain experts used the PVS interactive prover to prove theorems that
characterize the correctness of the criteria.  We were able to apply
the Copilot prover using Z3~\cite{DeMoura2008} to prove many of these theorems
within the Copilot framework. Among the properties proven about the
horizontal separation criteria are:

\texttt{horiz\_criteria}(\bm{sx},  \bm{sy},
\epsilon,  \bm{vx},  \bm{vy}) & \Longleftrightarrow &
\texttt{horiz\_criteria}(\bm{-sx},  \bm{-sy},
\epsilon, \bm{-vx},  \bm{-vy})   \\ \\
( \texttt{horiz\_criteria}(\bm{sx},\bm{sy},
\epsilon, \bm{vx},\bm{vy}) \  \wedge &&  \\ 
\texttt{horiz\_criteria} (\bm{sx},  \bm{sy},
\epsilon,  \bm{wx}, \bm{wy}) )& \Longrightarrow&
\texttt{horiz\_criteria} (\bm{sx}, \bm{sy},
\epsilon,\bm{vx},\bm{vy})\\ \\
( \texttt{horiz\_criteria}(\bm{sx},  \bm{sy},
\epsilon,  \bm{vx},  \bm{vy}) \   \wedge  &&\\
\texttt{horiz\_criteria}(\bm{sx},  \bm{sy}, \epsilon',  \bm{vx},
\bm{vy}) )  &\Longrightarrow & \epsilon = \epsilon'
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{minipage}
}

\paragraph{}A few of the properties proven in PVS involve continuous mathematics
that remains beyond the capabilities of fully automated tools,
but combined with testing, we have a convincing argument that the
specification is correct.
