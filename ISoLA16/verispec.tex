\section{Monitor Specification Correctness}~\label{sec:verispec}


As RV is applied to  guarantee sophisticated properties, the
monitor specifications themselves will grow in complexity and become
prone to error.  Our experience with a number of case studies
involving complex monitor properties is that were able to discover
many simple theorems that should be true about a specification if it
is correct. Hence applying formal proof tools to the monitors to
ensure they are correct can safeguard that the last line of
defense is actually effective. Ideally, specification verification
capabilities should be integrated into the RV framework so engineers
could write specifications, verify their correctness, and generate
monitors in a seamless fashion.

\paragraph{Challenge:}  \emph{Assure  the correctness of the monitor
specification.}   



\paragraph{Copilot Approach:}  
 Copilot supports automated proofs of properties of specification
 properties  through its {\tt Copilot.Theorem} module.  Applying a 
``synchronous observer'' approach~\cite{amast93}, properties \emph{about}
Copilot programs are specified \emph{within} Copilot itself. In particular,
properties are encoded with standard Boolean streams and Copilot streams are
sufficient to encode past-time linear temporal logic~\cite{ptltl}.

 A proposition is a Copilot value of type \texttt{Prop Existential}
 or \texttt{Prop Universal}, which can be introduced using \texttt{exists} and
\texttt{forall}, respectively. These are functions taking as an argument a
normal Copilot stream of type \lstinline{Stream Bool}. Propositions can be added
to a specification using the \texttt{prop} and \texttt{theorem} functions,
where \texttt{theorem} must also be passed a tactic for automatically proving
the proposition. Currently, proof engines  based on
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (\textsc{smt})   are used to discharge
proofs.  The Copilot prover was first introduced
in~\cite{pike-rv-15}, where its utility was demonstrated in assuring
notoriously subtle voting algorithms to be used for fault-tolerant RV.

In the course of the analysis of the separation criteria, a team of
domain experts used the PVS interactive prover to prove theorems that
characterize the correctness of the criteria.  We were able to apply
the Copilot prover using Z3~\cite{XXX} to prove many of these theorems
within the Copilot framework. Among the properties proved about the
horizontal separation criteria are

\begin{eqnarray*}
\texttt{horiz\_criteria}(\bm{sx},  \bm{sy},
\epsilon,  \bm{vx},  \bm{vy}) & \Longleftrightarrow &
\texttt{horiz\_criteria}(\bm{-sx},  \bm{-sy},
\epsilon, \bm{-vx},  \bm{-vy})   \\
( \texttt{horiz\_criteria}(\bm{sx},\bm{sy},
\epsilon, \bm{vx},\bm{vy}) ) \wedge &&  \\ 
\texttt{horiz\_criteria} (\bm{sx},  \bm{sy},
\epsilon,  \bm{wx}, \bm{wy})& \Longrightarrow&
\texttt{horiz\_criteria} (\bm{sx}, \bm{sy},
\epsilon,\bm{vx},\bm{vy})\\
( \texttt{horiz\_criteria}(\bm{sx},  \bm{sy},
\epsilon,  \bm{vx},  \bm{vy})  \wedge  &&\\
\texttt{horiz\_criteria}(\bm{sx},  \bm{sy},
\epsilon',  \bm{vx},  \bm{vy}) )  &\Longrightarrow & \epsilon = \epsilon'
\end{eqnarray*}
A few of the properties proved in PVS  involve complex existential quantifiers over
the real numbers and would require the use of a interactive prover,
but combined with testing we have a convincing argument that we got the
specification correct.
