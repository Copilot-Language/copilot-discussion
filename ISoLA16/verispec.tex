 Question: Is the specification correct?
    }%
}

\begin{itemize}
\item Monitor specs are safety properties. 
\item Spec needs to be validated against the requirements. Maybe spec
  language needs to be closer to  language of domain.  Copilot
  libraries. 
\item Many LTL specs may be very strait forward, but we found that the
  specs in FT and airspace management were subtle and easy to get
  wrong. 
\item Modern verification tools such as SMT solvers can be integrated
  with the RV framework. 
\item An example from Airspace management.
