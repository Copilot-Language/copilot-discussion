\section{Observability}\label{sec:observ} 

   Technically speaking, an RV monitor takes a logical specificaiton
  $\phi$ and execution trace $\tau$ of state information of the SUO
  and decidws wheter $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$.  Ensuring observability of
  system state requried by the specification is one of the principal
  engineering challenges of RV.  How an RV framework obtains state
  data impacts the properties that can be monitored. Many of RV
  frameworks such as MAC~\cite{KimLKS04}  and MOP~\cite{ChenR05}
  instrument the software and hardware of the SUO so that it emits
  events of interest to the monitor.  While attractive from the
  veiwpoint of maximizing state observability, the additional overhead
  may affect execution time affectiing worst case
  execution times and consequently the scheduling; in addition regulatory
  guidelines may require recertificaiton of that software.  Copilot
  and several other RV frameworks~\cite{sampling} and!\cite{borzoo}
  opt to sacrifice complete observability by sampling
  events.  Copilot samples variables via shared memory. In a diffent approach
  to sampling,~\cite{Kane15} observes messages on  the controller area
  network (CAN)  bus of  an IA
  automobile.   

\paragraph{Challenge} Are the state and environmental variables in the
specification  observable.   

  \paragraph{Example} In our research applying RV to  the safe operation of a IA aircraft,
  we have the found that  the monitor specifications typically require
  us to observe  the state of the vehicle such  as position, altitude,
  pitch,  and ground  speed.   The aircraft  safe separation  criteria
  specification  involves   state  data  about  other   aircraft.  The
  diversity of data  sources can complicate the  translation of safety
  properties  into  monitor specifications  and  we  ask a  number  of
  questions.  Can  we actually  obtain the  information?  Is  the data
  found  in  program  variables,  on board  sensors,  or  obtained  by
  communications?  If it  is  raw sensor  data, do  we  need to  apply
  filters  before feeding  the data  into  the monitors?  Is the  data
  available   in  the   same  coordinate   systems  demanded   of  the
  specification?  Can  we ensure the  integrity and provenance  of the
  data  being observed?  More  items are  likely to  be  added to  the
  checklist with further experience.

  Copilot monitors sample the state of the system through shared
  memory. Each monitor runs as a task separate from the SUO.
  Currently, we rely on scheduling analysis with a good amount of
  experimentation. We have recently began investigating the
  possibility of applying abstract interpretation to inform monitor
  scheduling.


 

  

%\begin{itemize} 
%\item Does the monitor possess access to the necessary sensor data to
 % monitor state of the SUO?
%\item Do those sensors even exist?
%\item Need to preform traditional signal processing (filtering etc)
%\item  If sampling:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Can you estimate missed values
%\item Can you figure out when to sample.
%\end{itemize}
%\item static analysis tools can help with code instrumentation 
%\item static analysis can help with determining when to sample based
 % on decision points in code. etc timing analysis for hard realtime
 % systems.
