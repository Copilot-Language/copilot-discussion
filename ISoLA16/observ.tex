 Question: Are the monitor specification properties observable? 
    }%
}


\begin{itemize} 
\item Does the monitor possess access to the necessary sensor data to
  monitor state of the SUO?
\item Do those sensors even exist?
\item Need to preform traditional signal processing (filtering etc)
\item  If sampling:
\begin{itemize}
\item Can you estimate missed values
\item Can you figure out when to sample.
\end{itemize}
\item static analysis tools can help with code instrumentation 
\item static analysis can help with determining when to sample based
  on decision points in code. etc timing analysis for hard realtime
  systems.
\end{itemize}
