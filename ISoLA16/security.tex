 Question: Does the RV create introduce security vulnerabilities?  
    }%
}

\begin{itemize}
\item The RV system shouldn't introduce new security vulnerabilities.
\item So analysis needs to be conducted.
\item Replication and what not needed for FT may simply create more
attack surfaces. 
\item Privacy may not or may not be an issue with this  
\item Does the monitor or steering communicate to outside parties? If
so you may have security issues. 
\item If the RV has a single point of failure like dependence on GPS,
it enables an obvious attack on the system. 
\item Consider a UAS where RV checks if a geofence has been violated
and brings down the aircraft in a controlled fashion. Could spoofing
GPS be turned into a denial of service attack or transform the vehicle
into a weapon to hurt someone.
