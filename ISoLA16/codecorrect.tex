 Question: Are the executable monitors correct with respect to the monitor specification? 
    }%
}
\begin{itemize}
\item We have approached this in two ways. 
\item Assuming the interpreter acts as the operational semantics and
  have Quickcheck generate many many tests. Very light weight. Bugs
  were found. 
\item C code is generated with assertions and we have Frama-C prove
  them correct.  Illustrate with examples. 
\end{itemize}

 Question: Are the executable monitors well defined programs with buffer overflows, integer overflows, etc?
    }%
}

\begin{itemize}
\item We have applied abstract interpretation to generated C code.
\item Currently investigating applying RV Match tool KCC developed
  under NASA SBIR award (XXXXX)  to the
  generated C code. 
\end{itemize}
