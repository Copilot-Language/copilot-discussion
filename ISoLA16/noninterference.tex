        Question: Do the monitors and steering interact with the SUO as well as each other in such as a way as to negatively impact safety?
    }%
}

\begin{itemize}
\item Safety is known not to be compositional. 
\item Keeping monitors independent help,but not a cure all. 
\item Can the steering interact with the SUO to create problems. 
\item Suppose I have a UAS with two monitors. One says if the vehicle  violates a
geofence another says it's gone way off the reservation so fly into
the ground. 
\item Maybe another example?
\item Basically we have to make sure that the composition of SUO and
monitors+steering don't impact safety.
