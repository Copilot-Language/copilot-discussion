\section{Conclusion}~\label{sec:conclusion} High-assurance RV has
the potential of becoming the avenue to assuring unpredictable and
otherwise unassurable IA safety-critical systems. We have presented a
number of challenges that we have identified as barriers to
actualizing high-assurance RV and surveyed how we have addressed these
challenges in the course of our own research using the Copilot
framework. We hope this list will be useful to RV researchers as they
apply their own work to safety-critical systems.  In addition, we
believe we have demonstrated the efficacy of applying light-weight
formal methods tools to address many of these challenges.  Progress on
these issues is likely to come faster if a multidisciplinary approach
is taken with domain specialists, safety engineers, verification tool
builders, all collaborating with RV researchers. Much work
remains and the list of challenges is likely to grow even as
researchers address many of the issues raised here are solved.

been conducted in collaboration with Dr. Lee Pike (Galois).  Jonathan
Laurent (ENS Paris)  and Chris Hathhorn (University of Missouri) did
most of the coding of the {\tt Copilot.Theorem}.   Georges-Axel
Jaloyan  recently added the new  monitor verification capabilities.
